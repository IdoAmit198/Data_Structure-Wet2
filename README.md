# Data_Structure-Wet2

Winter 20-21. Done in collaboration with Yaal Lekach Avivi.

After the great success of the application "Boom" from the first assignment, our task this time was to add few features in an efficient implementation.
Among them was to add a total time counter of watching per lecture, meaning how much time in total a lecture was watched.

We implemented from scratch Linked-List, Hash-Table, AVL-Tree, Dynamic-Array and more other classes and data structures in C++.
